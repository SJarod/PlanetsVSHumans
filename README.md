When opening the project with Unity for the first time,
the user must install some Unity Packages in the Package Manager :
- Universal Render Pipeline
- Visual Effect Graph

The visual effects may not work on the first try, the user needs to
open the FX files (FX_Meteor and FX_LaserBeam).
Opening the shader graphs may be required (to help the engine loading the visual effects).
